<h1>Project On Console</h1>

<p>The website that I used to make this website is Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a super cool software to help you code a website. If you want to know how to set it up, well I will tell you! First you search Visual studio Code on your search bar on the top of your screen. Then click the first search that will pop up on your screen. Or click the search which will say Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined. Open it up and you will see the donwload button on the top right of your screen. Now it's downloading! So that is how to set up Visual Studio Code!</p>

<p>A console application is a program designed to be used via a text-only computer interface, such as a text terminal, the command line interface of some operating systems (Unix, DOS, etc.) If you want to open the console screen or test the output in it all you need to  do is after you live test your webpage you need to right click on the webpage and you will see the option called inspect, click on that and you will see something called console in that. It should pop up there.</p>
